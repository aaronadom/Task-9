# Task-9
HyperionDev - Defensive Programming Project

This program is an simple calculator application that displays the calculation and writes it onto a text file.
Defensive programming is used to make the application robust and handle unexpected events and user inputs.

The program is then extended to give the user the option of using the calculator application as before or read all equations from a new text file (the user should add the name of the text file as an input). 
Defensive programming is used to ensure the program does not crash if the file does not exist and the user is promoted again to enter the name of th file.
